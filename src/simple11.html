		<h1>Making loops</h1>

<p>
	A loop makes a computer
	do something, such as
	display a message, over
	and over again. To make a
	loop in a program, you use
	the commands <code class="command">FOR</code>, <code class="command">TO</code>
	and <code class="command">NEXT</code>.
</p>

<h2>Uglymug loop</h2>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 FOR K=1 TO 5
30 PRINT "HELLO UGLYMUG"
40 NEXT K
</pre>

<p>
The loop in this program
begins with the <code class="command">FOR</code>, <code class="command">TO</code>
command in line 20. It tells
the computer how many
times to repeat the <code class="command">PRINT</code>
command. The command,
<code class="command">NEXT</code>, in line 40 tells the
computer to loop back and
carry out the <code class="command">PRINT</code>
command again.
</p>

<h2>How a loop works</h2>
<p>
	A loop is rather like a race where
	the runner has to go round the
	track several times. Each
	time the computer
	carries out the
	instruction in a loop, it
	is like running one lap
	of the race.
</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 FOR J = 1 TO 6
30 PRINT "HELLO"
40 NEXT J
RUN
</pre>

<p>
	In this loop program, the
	computer uses the variable <code>J</code>
	to keep count of the laps. <code>J</code> is called the "loop variable".
	At the beginning, the number
	in <code>J</code> is 1. Each time the computer goes round the loop, the number in <code>J</code> goes up
	by 1 until it reaches 6. Then
	the loop is finished.
</p>

<h3>Looking inside a loop</h3>
<p>This program lets you look inside a loop, so
	you can see the computer keeping count of
	the laps.</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 FOR L=1 TO 20
30 PRINT "LAP ";L
40 NEXT L
RUN
</pre>

<h3>Loop puzzle!</h3>

<p>Can you complete this program, so the
	computer displays your name ten times.
	You need to fill in the numbers in line 20,
	and put your name in quotes after the
	<code class="command">PRINT</code> command in line 30.</p>

<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 FOR J= TO
30 PRINT
40 NEXT J
RUN
</pre>

	<h2>Loopy programs</h2>
	<p>Here are some more ways of using loops in programs.</p>

	<h3>Counting program</h3>
<p>Loops are very useful for
	making a computer count.
	Try this program, which
	makes the computer count up to any number you like.
	When you run the program,
	you type in the number you
	want the computer to count to.</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 PRINT "WHAT NUMBER SHALL"
30 PRINT "I COUNT TO?"
40 INPUT N
50 FOR K=1 TO N
60 PRINT K
70 NEXT K
RUN
</pre>

<h3>Different ways of counting</h3>
<p>
	You can change the way the
	computer counts. For
	instance, you can make it
	count in jumps. To do this,
	you use the command
	<code class="command">STEP</code> followed by a number.
	The program below makes
	the computer count in steps
	of 5. Try running it.
</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 FOR L=0 TO 30 STEP 5
30 PRINT L
40 NEXT L
RUN
</pre>

<h3>Countdown</h3>
<p><code class="command">STEP</code> with a minus number
	makes the computer count
	backwards. Try this
	countdown program to see
	how it works.</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 PRINT "COUNTDOWN"
30 FOR J=10 TO 1 STEP -1
40 PRINT J
50 NEXT J
60 PRINT "BLAST OFF!"
RUN
</pre>

<h3>Making the computer wait</h3>
<p>
	A loop with no instructions inside it makes
	the computer pause for a moment. It is called
	a delay loop. In the program below, the delay
	loop in lines 30 and 40 makes the computer
	pause before it displays the second message.
	You can alter the length of the pause by
	changing the second number in the <code class="command">FOR</code>, <code class="command">TO</code>
	command. Have a go at shortening or
	lengthening the pause in the
	program.
</p>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 PRINT "HELLO EVERYBODY"
30 FOR K=1 TO 1000
40 NEXT K
50 PRINT "HELLO AGAIN"
</pre>

<h2>Using the loop variable</h2>
<p>This program makes the
	computer display the nine-
	times table. The loop variable,
	<code>K</code>, is used both for counting
	the loops, and for doing the
	sum inside the loop.</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 FOR K=1 TO 12
30 LET A = K*9
40 PRINT K;" x 9 =";A
50 NEXT K
RUN
</pre>

<p>
In this next program the computer
uses the loop variable, <code>J</code>, as the
number for the <code class="command">PRINT TAB</code>
command. This means that each time the computer repeats
the loop it leaves one more space before the word HELLO.
</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 FOR J=1 TO 10
30 PRINT TAB(J); "HELLO"
40 NEXT J
RUN
</pre>
