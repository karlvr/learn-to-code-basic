		<h1>Using INPUT</h1>
		<p>Another way to give the computer information is with the command <code class="command">INPUT</code>.
			<code class="command">INPUT</code> lets you put
			information into the
			computerâ€™s memory while
			the program is running. This means that you can
			give the computer different information,
			each time you
			run a program.</p>
		<p>You always put a variable name after <code class="command">INPUT</code>.
			When the computer meets <code class="command">INPUT</code> it
			waits for you to type something and stores it in the named variable.</p>
		<p>This computer tells you it is waiting by displaying a question mark.</p>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 PRINT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?"
30 INPUT N$
40 PRINT "HOW OLD ARE YOU?"
50 INPUT A
60 CLS
70 PRINT N$; " IS "; A
80 PRINT "YEARS OLD"
</pre>

<aside>
	The line <code>INPUT N$</code> tells the computer to expect words because the variable name ends with <code>$</code>,
	while the line <code>INPUT A</code> tells the computer to expect a number.
</aside>

<h2>Computer calculator</h2>
<p>See if you can fill in the missing lines in this program. The program makes your computer work as a calculator. You type in two numbers and the computer adds them
	together and puts the answer on the screen. You need to fill in lines 30 and 50 with
<code class="command">INPUT</code> commands.
</p>
<aside>Remember to enter <code class="command">NEW</code> before typing the next program to clear the previous one.</aside>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 PRINT "TYPE A NUMBER"
30
40 PRINT "TYPE ANOTHER NUMBER"
50
60 C=A+B
70 PRINT A;"+";B;"=";C
</pre>

<aside>
	The line <code>C=A+B</code> tells the computer to add the two numbers and store the answer in <code>C</code>
</aside>

<h2>Message program puzzle</h2>
<p>Here is another program puzzle. When you run the program the computer asks for a message. Then it asks who the message is for and who is sending it.</p>
<p>The computer stores this information in variables <code>A$</code>,
	<code>B$</code> and <code>M$</code>. Then it clears the screen and displays the
	message.</p>
<p>Can you complete the <code class="command">PRINT</code> commands in lines 90 and 110
	so the computer displays the names stored in <code>A$</code> and <code>B$</code>, with the message?</p>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 PRINT "WHAT IS THE MESSAGE?"
30 INPUT M$
40 PRINT "WHO IS IT FOR?"
50 INPUT AS
60 PRINT "WHO IS IT FROM?"
70 INPUT B$
80 CLS
90 PRINT
100 PRINT M$
110 PRINT
</pre>
