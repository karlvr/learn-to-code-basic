		<h1><code class="command">IF</code> and <code class="command">THEN</code> programs</h1>

<p>
You can make a computer do all sorts of things after an
<code class="command">IF</code> and <code class="command">THEN</code> command. For instance, you can tell it to
jump to another program line using the command
<code class="command">GOTO</code>. You can also make it stop the program.
</p>

<h2>Using <code class="command">GOTO</code></h2>

<p>
In this program you have to
guess how many cakes Slimy
Sid has eaten. If your guess is wrong, the <code class="command">GOTO</code> command
makes the computer jump back
to line 50 so you can have
another go. The computer
will go on doing this until
you get the answer right.
</p>

<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 LET C=17
30 PRINT "GUESS HOW MANY CAKES"
40 PRINT "SLIMY SID HAS EATEN?"
50 INPUT G
60 IF G<>C THEN GOTO 50
70 PRINT "YOU'VE GUESSED IT!"
RUN
</pre>

<aside><p>Line 60 sends the computer back to line 50 if your guess is wrong.</p></aside>

<h3>Improving the program</h3>

<p>
	The cake program would be
	clearer if the computer told
	you when your guess was
	wrong. You can do this on
	most computers, by putting
	a <code class="command">PRINT</code> command after
	<code class="command">THEN</code> in line 60.
</p>
<p>Try typing in this version of line
	60. See what difference it makes to
	the program.</p>
<pre>
60 IF G<>C THEN PRINT "WRONG": GOTO 50
</pre>
<aside><p>Both <code class="command">PRINT</code> and <code class="command">GOTO</code>
	must be on the same
	line as <code class="command">IF</code> and <code class="command">THEN</code>.
	You separate them
	with a colon.</p></aside>

	<h2><code class="command">IF</code> and <code class="command">THEN</code> with <code class="command">STOP</code></h2>
<p>
This password program uses the command <code class="command">STOP</code> after <code class="command">IF</code> and <code class="command">THEN</code>. It tells the computer to stop the
program if you type in the wrong password. Most computers display a message
when they stop a program. This lets you know what line the program has stopped at.
</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 P$="BAKED BEANS"
30 PRINT "WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?"
40 INPUT A$
50 IF A$<>P$ THEN STOP
60 PRINT "CORRECT"
70 PRINT "WELCOME, FRIEND"
RUN
</pre>
<aside><p>Line 20 is the password. It is stored in the variable <code>P$</code>.</p></aside>
<p>Can you guess the password correctly? Remember that strings are case-sensitive so you'll need to enter the password using the same uppercase letters as it appears in the program (if you entered it like that).
	Remember you can always use <code class="command">LIST</code> to list your program.

	<h2>Maths machine</h2>
	<p>
	Try this program. When you
	run it, you give the computer
	two numbers. Then you tell it
	whether to add or multiply
	them by typing <code>A</code> or <code>M</code>.
	Lines 80 and 90 use <code class="command">IF</code> and <code class="command">THEN</code> to make the computer do the calculation
	you asked for; storing the answer in <code>Z</code>.
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 PRINT "GIVE ME TWO NUMBERS"
30 INPUT X: INPUT Y
40 PRINT "SHALL I ADD"
50 PRINT "OR MULTIPLY?"
60 PRINT "(TYPE A OR M)"
70 INPUT R$
80 IF R$="A" THEN Z=X+Y
90 IF R$="M" THEN Z=X*Y
100 PRINT "THE ANSWER IS ";Z
RUN
</pre>
<aside><p>Notice that we've used a <code>:</code> to put the two <code class="command">INPUT</code> commands on the same line of the program.</p></aside>
