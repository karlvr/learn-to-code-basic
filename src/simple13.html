		<h1>Programs and puzzles</h1>

<p>
	Here and on the next few pages, there are
	programs to try and puzzles to solve.
	They all involve BASIC commands
	covered in this book.
</p>

<h2>Words and spaces</h2>

<p>
	Try this program. It makes
	the computer display words
	next to each other on the screen.
</p>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 PRINT "RED";"ROSE"
30 PRINT "BLACK";"COAL"
40 PRINT "WHITE" ;"SNOW"
</pre>
<p>
See if you can change the
<code class="command">PRINT</code> lines to make spaces
between the words, as shown in #2 below.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Can you change the <code class="command">PRINT</code>
lines again so the computer
arranges the words in two
columns like in #3?
</p>

<h2>Star lines</h2>
<p>
	Run this program to make
	your computer display a
	line of stars at the side
	of the screen.
</p>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 FOR K=1 TO 10
30 PRINT TAB(3);"*"
40 NEXT K 
</pre>

<p>
	By changing the number
	after <code>TAB</code>, can you put the
	stars in the middle of the screen?
</p>
<p>
Can you change the program
again to make a line of stars
across the screen, like this?
