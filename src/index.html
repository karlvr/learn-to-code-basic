		<h1>Learn BASIC</h1>
		<p>We’re going to learn how to program a computer using the programming language that
			I learned to program with: BASIC. Once you’ve learned how to program in any language
			you’ll be able to pick up any new language pretty easily! So let’s start with an
			oldie but a goodie!

		<h1>What is BASIC?</h1>
		<p>To make a computer do things you need to give it instructions in a language it understands.
			BASIC, the language which most home computers used in the 1980’s,
			is quite like English, with some special words
			and symbols.</p>
		<p>If you give a computer instructions in ordinary English
			it will not understand what you mean.</p>
		<p>Giving a computer instructions is called programming and a list of instructions is called a program.
			Below you can see what a program in BASIC looks like.</p>

		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>First you should start with the Learn BASIC course I've put together from the same book I learned
			BASIC from.

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Now that you’ve learned some BASIC, here are some challenges for you to improve your skills. These
			aren’t supposed to be easy. You might need to put some time into experimenting and playing to try
			to work them out. Treat them like a puzzle! Hopefully you have fun!
		</p>
		<p>Do these in order as they will increase in complexity and I’ll assume things you’ve learned as we go.</p>
