		<h1>Sums with variables</h1>
		<p>You can make the computer do sums with numbers stored in variables. Try the
			program below. It makes the computer add and multiply the numbers stored in the variables
			<code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 A=2
30 B=5
40 PRINT A+B
50 PRINT A*B
RUN
</pre>
		<p>Answers displayed on their own are not very useful. If you add these <code class="command">PRINT</code>
			lines to the program, you can make the computer display the sum next to the answer.</p>
<pre>
35 PRINT A;"+";B;"=";
45 PRINT A;"x";B;"=";
</pre>
		<p>First <code class="command">LIST</code> your program and notice that because we used line numbers 35 and 45, those new lines were inserted into the program you've already entered.</p>
		<p>Now <code class="command">RUN</code> your program.</p>
		<p>Notice that you can also use a <code>;</code> at the end of a line to tell the computer not to start a new line with the next <code class="command">PRINT</code> command.</p>

		<h2>Cake program</h2>
		<p>Four monsters have been given 12 cakes and they want to share them out equally.
			The program below will solve the monsters problem. The variable <code>C</code> contains
			the number of cakes. <code>M</code> is the number of monsters and <code>A</code>
			is the answer.</p>
<pre>
NEW
10 CLS
20 C=12
30 M=4
40 A=C/M
50 PRINT "THERE ARE ";A;" CAKES"
60 PRINT "FOR EACH MONSTER"
RUN
</pre>
		<p>Run the program to find
			out how many cakes each
			monster will get.</p>
