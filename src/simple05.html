		<h1>Words and variables together</h1>
		<p>You often need to display words next to the contents of
			a variable. To do this you use <code class="command">PRINT</code> followed by the
			variable name and the words, separated by a semicolon. In BASIC a semicolon tells the
			computer to display the next piece of information on the same line.</p>
		<p>A semicolon looks like <code>;</code>.</p>
<pre>
10 CLS
20 N=7
30 PRINT N; "SLIMY SLUGS"
40 PRINT "ATE, ";N;" SOGGY SANDWICHES"
</pre>
		<p>The spaces <em>inside</em> the quotes on line 40 make the computer leave a space on the screen
			between the words and the contents of the variable. You can also leave spaces <em>outside</em>
		the quotes, but the computer ignores them.</p>
