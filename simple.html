		<h1>About this website</h1>
		<p>We’re going to learn how to program using the programming language that
			I learned to program with: BASIC. And we’re going to use materials from the
			beautiful <a href="https://usborne.com/nz/books/computer-and-coding-books">Usborne books</a> that I learned from!

		<h1>What is BASIC?</h1>
		<p>To make a computer do things you need to give it instructions in a language it understands.
			BASIC, the language which most home computers used in the 1980’s,
			is quite like English, with some special words
			and symbols.</p>
		<p>If you give a computer instructions in ordinary English
			it will not understand what you mean.</p>
		<p>Giving a computer instructions is called programming and a list of instructions is called a program.
			Below you can see what a program in BASIC looks like.</p>

		<h1>First commands in BASIC</h1>
		<p>On the right-hand side of the screen is your computer. You use this computer with the keyboard. It doesn’t use a mouse!</p>
		<h2>Using PRINT</h2>
		<p>To make the computer display a word on the screen, you
			type <code class="command">PRINT</code>, followed by the word inside quotes. Type carefully, as mistakes will
			confuse the computer.</p>
		<p>Try typing the line below into the computer and then to make the computer carry out the command, press the RETURN key.</p>
		<pre>
PRINT "HELLO"</pre>
		<p>When you press RETURN, the computer puts the word on the screen. Try using <code class="command">PRINT</code> to make your computer display other words and phrases!</p>

		<h2>Clearing the screen</h2>
		<p>To clear the screen we type the <code class="command">CLS</code> command.</p>
		<p>Try typing that into the computer now to clear the screen.</p>
