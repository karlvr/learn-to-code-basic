	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>On the righthand side of the screen is your computer. You can only interact with this computer by typing as it doesn’t use a mouse.</p>
	<p>On this page we’re going to learn how to enter programs into this computer.</p>

	<h2>Need Input</h2>

	<p>We’re going to type in your first program! Type in the following lines, including the line numbers, pressing [return] after typing each line:</p>
	<pre>
10 PRINT "What is your name
20 INPUT a$
30 PRINT "Nice to meet you " a$</pre>
	<aside>
		<p>If the computer says <em>Syntax error</em> or anything strange happens, check that you’ve typed exactly what appears above including the line numbers.</p>
	</aside>
	<p>Each line starts with its line number. If you make a mistake on a line you can edit it using its line number. Type <code class="command">EDIT 10</code> to edit line 10, then press [return] to finish editing.</p>
	<p>When you’ve finished typing your program type <code class="command">LIST</code> to show your program. If you’ve made any mistakes, edit the line that contains the mistake. If you’ve added extra lines you can remove them using the line number, for example <code class="command">DELETE 10</code>.</p>
	<p>Run your program by typing <code class="command">RUN</code>.

<h2>Print</h2>

	<p>The <code>PRINT</code> command prints whatever comes after it. On line 10 we gave <code>PRINT</code> a <em>string literal</em>, that is a <em>string</em> of text surrounded by <code>""</code>s.
		You could type whatever you like inside those quotes. Type <code class="command">EDIT 10</code> now to change the message that gets printed out. Type <code class="command">RUN</code> to run your new program.</p>

	<p>If you type a line that doesn’t start with a line number, the computer runs that command immediately rather than adding it to your program to run later. Let’s try printing a few different things to see how versatile the <code>PRINT</code> command is.</p>

	<pre>
PRINT 42
PRINT "Basic"
PRINT 3.14
PRINT 8*7</pre>

	<p>The last line above multiplies two numbers. Try printing a few more equations. You can use <code>*</code> for multiply, <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> as usual, and <code>/</code> for divide. You can also use <code>()</code> for more complex equations.</p>

<h2>Uppercase lowercase</h2>

<p>This programming language is called BASIC. It doesn’t matter whether you use uppercase letters or lowercase letters to type its commands, like <code>PRINT</code>, or variables, like <code>a$</code>; BASIC treats uppercase, lowercase or mixed-case as the same. Where it <em>does</em> matter is in strings.</p>

<pre>
print "It matters in strings
input A$
print "But not in variables
print a$
